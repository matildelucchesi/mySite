# PPM front-end lab

I used both Flexbox and Grid to create a responsive layout.

There is a drop-down menu with downward animation and the presence of an overlay that obscures the page below when the drop-down menu is opened.

Also, when the search icon in the header is no longer visible, a search bar appears in the dropdown menu.

By clicking on the search icon, the search bar appears below the header.

Going over the header button with the mouse, there is a variation of the color of the button and of the text inside it
