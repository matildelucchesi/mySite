#PPM front-end lab
##I used both Flexbox and Grid to create a responsive layout. 
##There is a drop-down menu with downward animation and the presence of an overlay that obscures the page below when the drop-down menu is opened.
##Also, when the search icon in the header is no longer visible, a search bar appears in the dropdown menu.
##By clicking on the search icon, the search bar appears below the header.
